HI I tried calling u . but your phone was busy.
I am sorry to say that the house is not getting vacated as the tenant needs to stay [for a serious reason] and cannot vacate. He called me this morning and requested to continue the agreement for next 6 months at-least.
Please provide your account number as I have to return the advance. 

Excuse the inconvenience .
Vinod
